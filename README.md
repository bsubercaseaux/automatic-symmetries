# Automated Symmetric Constructions in Discrete Geometry
Code corresponding to our CICM'2025 submission "Automated Symmetric Constructions in Discrete Geometry".
This is joint work of Bernardo Subercaseaux, Ethan Mackey, Long Qian, and Marijn Heule.

## Requirements

For SAT encodings in Python, we use the `eznf` and `PySAT` libraries. They can be installed by
```
pip install eznf
pip install python-sat
```

For the realizability problem we use the `Localizer` solver (https://github.com/bsubercaseaux/localizer).


## Symmetries in the Erd≈ës-Szekeres problem

## Symmetries in the Everywhere-unbalanced-points problem

## Automated proof of Proposition 4.2
